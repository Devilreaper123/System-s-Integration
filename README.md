** Project Name: Assignment 1 System's Integration **
Welcome to the GitHub repository of Ronit Shahu! This repository houses the code for our innovative project. Whether you're looking to contribute or simply explore, we're glad you're here!

Getting Started
These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

Prerequisites
Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

Python 3.9 or Higher
pip (Python package installer)
1. Setting Up a Virtual Environment
It's recommended to use a virtual environment to manage dependencies for your project. This keeps your project dependencies separate from your system-wide Python packages.
    pip install virtualenv
2. Create a Virtual Environment:
Navigate to the project directory and run:
    virtualenv venv
3. Activate the Virtual Environment:
On Windows:
    .\venv\Scripts\activate
On Unix or MacOS:
    source venv/bin/activate
5. Install Dependencies:
With the virtual environment active, install the project dependencies:
    pip install -r Requirements.txt
6. Running the Application
With your virtual environment setup and dependencies installed, you can now run the application:
    python app.py
